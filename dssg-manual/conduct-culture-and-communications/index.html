fellows, staff, and visitors.</p>
<h3 id="anti-harassment-policy">Anti-Harassment Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#anti-harassment-policy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Our Anti-Harassment Policy explicitly outlines the behavior for which we have a <strong>zero tolerance policy</strong>.
If you feel that you or anyone else is being harassed or treated
unfairly, or have any other concerns related to this policy,
<strong>please contact one of your fellow advocates.</strong> All contact with
the fellow advocates will be confidential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Data Science for Social Good is dedicated to providing a
harassment-free experience in all event venues, including talks,
parties, and online media, for everyone regardless of gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, age or religion. <strong>We do not tolerate
harassment of participants in any form.</strong></p>
<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, age, race, religion,
the use or display of sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical
contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop
any such behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
comply immediately and may be sanctioned or expelled from the
fellowship and/or all related events at the discretion of the
organizers. Organizers may take any lawful action we deem appropriate,
including but not limited to warning the offender or asking the
offender to leave the specific event or the fellowship program as a
whole.</p>
<p>If you feel anyone has violated this policy, please bring it up
directly with the individual or with a DSSG staff member or fellow
advocate.</p>
<p>If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this code of
conduct, please contact the fellowship staff team with a concise
description of your grievance; all grievances will be considered.</p>
<h2 id="goals-of-the-fellowship">Goals of the Fellowship<a class="headerlink" href="#goals-of-the-fellowship" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Our long-term, overarching, unifying goal is to see more of this type
of work happen in the world, and for our fellows to leave the program
better equipped and more likely to use their skills for social good.</p>
<p>To achieve this vision, our program focuses on three guiding goals. Our goals are (in order of priority):</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#training-our-fellows">Training Our Fellows</a></li>
<li><a href="#introducing-data-science-to-the-social-sector">Introducing Data Science to the Social Sector</a></li>
<li><a href="#building-a-community-of-data-scientists-for-social-good">Building a Community of Data Scientists for Social Good</a></li>
</ol>
<p>We know that these goals are lofty. We do not presume or pretend to
know the optimal way to achieve them, but we believe it's worth
trying. We want all of you to help us by actively contributing ideas
to improve our program and achieve these goals more effectively.</p>
<h4 id="training-our-fellows">Training Our Fellows<a class="headerlink" href="#training-our-fellows" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p><strong>First and foremost, DSSG is a training program for fellows.</strong> We
believe that the best way to learn is by working on real projects and
not toy examples, which is why fellows work on <em>real projects</em> for
<em>real partners</em>, in teams with other <em>real people</em>. The program
provides training in the form of hands-on technical data science
experience, but that’s not enough to do real data science for social
good. The training aspect of the fellowship also includes working with
project partners, understanding social issues, using social science
methods, working collaboratively on a team, developing solutions in an
agile way, and communicating effectively to technical and
non-technical audiences.</p>
<p>We start off with a week of intensive orientation, getting everyone
acquainted with each other and the structure of the program, as well
as making sure all the fellows are up to speed with the tools and
methods that are fellowship-wide standards. Training continues
throughout the summer with lectures and workshops by staff, guest
speakers, and fellow teach-outs. Dedicated full-time data science
mentors and project managers will support and guide fellows throughout
the summer.</p>
<p>In short, we want the summer to be a productive and collaborative
experience for you, and will provide you with many resources; however,
<strong>your biggest resource will be yourself and the other fellows in your
cohort</strong>. Every fellow contributes their own wealth of experience and
expertise, and we aim to foster a learning environment where everyone
can share this knowledge and learn from one another.</p>
<h4 id="introducing-data-science-to-the-social-sector">Introducing Data Science to the Social Sector<a class="headerlink" href="#introducing-data-science-to-the-social-sector" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>We believe that data-driven decisionmaking isn’t reserved for
companies selling online advertisements or banks trying to detect
fraud. We know that data science can help governments, non-profits,
and social good organizations do their work more effectively.</p>
<p>All of our project partners collect data, and many are already using
data in some way, whether to evaluate their programs and write reports
for their funders. However, most social good organizations have not
used data science to actively inform their ongoing decision
processes. Through this program, we aim to increase awareness of the
benefits and challenges of data-driven impact work, both among the
partners we work with and among non-profits and governments in
general.</p>
<p><strong>Our project partners are partners, not clients.</strong> This means that
the fellows work <em>with</em> the partners, not <em>for</em> them. We believe that
participating in this program helps both the partners and the fellows
develop a common language. Sometimes fellows and partners won't see
eye to eye on every decision, or the need to complete work within a
deadline will mean you have to adjust your expectations, put <a href="http://vim-adventures.com/">learning
VIM</a> on the back burner, or sacrifice
doing the work exactly the way you had hoped. While fellows' learning
is our primary priority, it is important to note that part of what
fellows are learning is how to work with partners to produce work that
is useful for the partners and delivered on time.</p>
<h4 id="building-a-community-of-data-scientists-for-social-good">Building a Community of Data Scientists for Social Good<a class="headerlink" href="#building-a-community-of-data-scientists-for-social-good" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p><strong>We hope -- and expect -- that your impact as a DSSG alum continues
beyond your summer tenure.</strong> Throughout the summer, we will introduce
you to other practitioners within the data science and social good
spaces to help you understand these sectors, form relationships, and
start to think about potential contributions you could make. You’ll
also have the opportunity to network with local data science, tech,
government, non-profit, and startup communities through regular
fellowship-sponsored happy hours and meetups.</p>
<p>Whether it’s continuing to collaborate with your DSSG colleagues on
other social good projects, joining the data team at a government
agency, or working to recruit other like-minded people to apply their
in-demand data science skills to impactful problems, we hope that this
is just the beginning of of a lifetime as a data scientist for social
good.</p>
<h2 id="our-hopes-for-your-fellowship-experience">Our Hopes for Your Fellowship Experience<a class="headerlink" href="#our-hopes-for-your-fellowship-experience" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The fellowship provides you with the opportunity to learn; to work on
important, challenging, and unique projects; and to meet a lot of
people who share your interests and goals. It is up to you to take
advantage of these opportunities.</p>
<p>We hope you use the summer to:
* Meet a group of fellows, staff and project partners who have a
  wealth of skills and experiences; listen to and learn from them; and
  make new friends.
* Embrace gaps in your knowledge as learning opportunities, exploring
  your limitations with respect to technical skills, new methods from
  different disciplines, project management, social issues, and
  teamwork.
* Learn about the challenges of working on real projects that don’t
  have clean data, guaranteed results, or elegant solutions.
* Navigate the triangle between learning technical skills, creating
  deliverables that are useful and actionable for your project
  partner, and putting the varied skills within your team to good
  use.
* Rise to the challenge of working on a team that will include strong personalities with diverse experiences and strengths
* Realize the ambiguity and uncertainty that comes with working in a
  traditionally less tech-savvy sector, and learn how to communicate
  effectively to bridge this gap.
* Explore the impact (intentional and unintentional) that working with
  data from real, often disadvantaged or marginalized, people might
  have on them.
* Think deeply about the scope and limitations of technology to improve social problems.
* Explore existing roles in the field of data science for social good,
  find one you are best suited for, or create your own.</p>
<p><strong>Throughout the summer, we encourage you to share your ideas about
how to improve the fellowship experience for yourself and others --
and to put them into action.</strong> We are constantly trying to improve the
fellowship every day throughout the summer, and over time as we learn
from each cohort.</p>
<h2 id="our-expectations-of-fellows">Our Expectations of Fellows<a class="headerlink" href="#our-expectations-of-fellows" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The fellowship offers a lot of freedom; however, we expect all fellows
to stick to the basic principles of conduct listed below at all
times. These guidelines apply to everybody at the fellowship,
including mentors, project managers, and the fellowship
organizers. <em>If you feel that anyone is not behaving in accordance
with these guidelines, we invite you to bring it up constructively. If
you are unsure who to address, or if you do not feel comfortable doing
so directly, you can bring up your concerns with the fellow advocate.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Be supportive, open-minded, and willing to compromise.</strong> DSSG
  brings together people from different backgrounds and with different
  skills. In fact, this might be the best resource the fellowship has
  to offer! Share your knowledge and your experience with each
  other. Be patient as you teach each other, and have an open ear for
  your peers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be professional.</strong> You will be working with NGOs, non-profits, and
  government institutions as project partners. You will also be
  presenting your work at and attending events with the general
  public. In all of these capacities you are acting as a
  representative of the DSSG community. We expect you to be
  professional — that is, respectful, friendly, and on time — in your
  conduct with partners and the public alike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be resourceful and pragmatic.</strong> Own your own learning. Seek out
  resources as necessary. Don't be shy to ask others for help, but be
  mindful of their time - tell them what what you do understand, where
  you're stuck, and what you’ve already tried, so they know how they
  can help. When you notice problems or have ideas for improvements —
  be it in your team, your project, or the fellowship — don’t rely on
  others to notice or fix them; offer your initiative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deal with conflicts maturely.</strong> There are many potential sources
  of conflict throughout the fellowship. It is perfectly acceptable,
  and even expected, that you will run into conflicts with your team,
  your mentors, your project, or the fellowship organizers. In any
  case, we ask you to be productive, pragmatic, and mature when
  dealing with conflicts. Keep an open mind, listen and communicate
  with everybody involved.  Neither your project, nor your team, nor
  the fellowship will be perfect. Remember that everyone involved has
  invested a lot in the fellowship and wants all participants to be
  happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Show up.</strong> We have all committed to be here for the duration of
  the program. The fellowship runs from approximately Memorial Day
  through Labor Day (specific dates change by year). We expect you to
  be in the office five days a week, to attend all DSSG-wide sessions,
  occasional special events, and the final event. We recognize that
  you have a life outside of the fellowship, and <em>if you have any
  known or potential absences, you must inform DSSG staff upon your
  acceptance.</em> Any additional conflicts that arise during the summer
  must be discussed with and agreed between you, your team, and your
  project manager well ahead of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take care of the space.</strong> Offices, meeting rooms, and kitchen
  areas are shared spaces. It’s everybody’s job to keep the space
  clean and free of messes. This policy also applies when you are
  attending off-site events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stay involved and act as a steward.</strong> As a member of the DSSG
  community, we expect a commitment from you to stay involved, even
  after the summer. We ask you to seek opportunities to present the
  work you did, whether it's at your university, company, or events in
  your area. We ask you to assist your team in writing publications
  about your project, both during and after the fellowship. We will
  also ask you to help us with the application process in the
  following years by reviewing applications and interviewing
  candidates. We ask that you do what you're able to contribute to the
  DSSG mission and community.</p>
</li>

<p>Regardless of how much experience you have, we admitted you because we
believe that you can make a valuable contribution to your cohort,
and we think being a DSSG fellow will help prepare you to do data
science for social good in the real world. We've made a commitment
to you and want to do everything we can to help you succeed. This is
really important, so we'll say it again, in bold: <strong>If you're
reading this, you are here because we want you to be here and
believe that you are ready to make an impact.</strong> For example, don't
worry about how much more or less productive, knowledgable, or
experienced other fellows in your cohort might appear to be. It's
easy to only pay attention - and compare yourself - to those who
seem to be doing particularly well. Know that everyone has their own
struggles, and everyone has good and bad days.</p>

<h3 id="the-space">The Space<a class="headerlink" href="#the-space" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Each year we rent a space in Chicago. While the space changes from
year to year, in general the layout is open, and teams sit at desks
together. There is private conference space for team meetings and
calls with partners. Upon arrival, you will receive the conference
room request and reservation policy. We also provide access to a
kitchen, with coffee and an espresso maker. We provide a limited
supply of snacks and catered meals for special events. Let us know if
you have any special food restrictions.</p>
<p>You will learn more about space logistics (location, key card access,
etc.) by email as they are finalized in the weeks leading up to the
fellowship.</p>
<h3 id="the-people">The People<a class="headerlink" href="#the-people" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The foundation of any good project is a good team. We’ve worked to
recruit and hand pick a passionate and skilled team of
interdisciplinary folks that all bring unique skills to your
cohort. The fellowship is comprised of teams of three or four
<strong>fellows</strong> each. Your teammates will be fellow graduate students and
recent graduates. We aim to ensure that each team has a mix of
backgrounds, from computer science, statistics, math, physical science
and engineering, social sciences and public policy.</p>
<p>Your team will be assigned a <strong>Senior Data Science Mentor</strong>. Each
Mentor will be working with several teams of fellows, supporting their
growth and project. All mentors are experienced data scientists who
serve as a resource for you through the project development process,
both with hands-on technical problems and implementation questions, as
well as through higher-level design decisions.</p>
<p>In addition to Technical Mentors, you will have a <strong>Project
Manager</strong>. Each Project Manager oversees several teams and is
responsible for managing your relationship with your project
partner. They work with you and your partner to set goals and
deadlines, ensure proper communication between your team and your
partner, and help tackle issues that are blocking your progress. Your
Project Manager is also a great resource for questions about
organizing teamwork, improving presentation skills, and communicating
with the public.</p>
<p>If fellows have any kind of questions or concerns that they would like
to discuss confidentially, they can address the <strong>Fellow
Advocate</strong>. This is a member of staff who is not involved directly in
managing the fellowship, and who is available to help with any
conflict between fellows and members of staff. The advocate can also
raise concerns or ask for help on behalf of fellows, should they feel
uncomfortable doing so themselves.</p>
<p>The fellowship has one or more <strong>Interns</strong>, who help with all
organizational and administrative tasks that the summer brings, like
setting up the space, helping organize and publicize events, and
recording tutorials. In their remaining time, interns might also help
teams with their projects or work on their own self-directed data
science projects.</p>
<p>The <strong>Communications Manager</strong> prepares media and press releases and
manages interactions with the press. The communications manager helps
fellows practice and polish their final presentations, and gives
feedback on blog posts and other write-ups. We strongly believe in the
importance of communicating the work we do, to our project partners,
as well as to the broader public. To that end, we will spend a lot of
the summer asking fellows to present their work and give them
continuous feedback on the presentations.</p>
<p>The <strong>Fellowship Organizers</strong> have spent months planning and preparing
the summer program. They select fellows, mentors, project managers,
interns, and project partners, find a space, secure funding, prepare
the summer’s curriculum, and plan all fellowship events. Over the
summer, they will lead some of the fellowship-wide activities (such as
the weekly deep dives and stand-ups), and teach some of the
workshops. They also supervise the mentors, project managers, interns,
and the communications manager.</p>
<h3 id="the-curriculum">The Curriculum<a class="headerlink" href="#the-curriculum" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Our goal is for you to learn a LOT this summer. We want you to feel
empowered to drive your education throughout the summer. We see
learning opportunities falling into three main buckets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Directed Learning</strong>: We will share specific resources and
  guidelines for topics that we find useful in order to kick-start
  this learning process. We then encourage you to dive in and learn
  the skills most applicable to you and your growth.</li>
<li><strong>Peer-Directed Learning</strong>: We aim to create an environment that
  facilitates learning among fellows. Whether it’s an informal
  discussion over lunch or a more formal teaching session, we
  encourage you to take advantage of the diversity of experiences and
  skills in the room.</li>
<li><strong>Fellowship-Directed Learning</strong>: Lastly, we have developed a
  specific workshop curriculum to cover basic concepts that we believe
  are essential for the summer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It is up to you to make sure you are seeking the resources you need
to learn the skills you want to learn.</strong> For example, in the past,
groups of fellows have started reading groups to learn about similar
topics, like deep learning, together. That being said, <em>if you are
lost, speak up.</em> You shouldn't feel that you are unable to make a
meaningful contribution to your project. Your technical mentor is
available to help you tackle skill gaps.</p>
<p>In all of this, we recognize that there is no definitive “Data Science
for Social Good” curriculum or roadmap. We are charting new territory
and developing it together. Throughout the summer, there will be
plenty of opportunities for feedback and brainstorming on how to
improve learning; for example, in past summers we have held an
informal “Dunkin’ Discussion” series where we discuss the future of
data science for social good over donuts.</p>
<h3 id="the-tools">The Tools<a class="headerlink" href="#the-tools" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We typically use GitHub for storing our codebase, Amazon Web Services
for our data storage and analysis, Slack for fellowship-wide
communication, and Trello for project management. We also store
team-wide and fellowship-wide documents on Google Drive, and we
schedule meetings on Google Calendar. You will receive a University of
Chicago email address to use for the duration of the fellowship. You

<p>Teams will work together to develop specific team norms, but each team
will have a daily morning stand up meeting with their project manager
and technical mentors. In these meetings, each fellow will have the
opportunity to discuss what they did the day before, what they’re
planning to do today, and what they’re stuck on.</p>
<p>In addition to that daily meeting, teams will have weekly conference
calls with their project partner to provide updates, ask questions,
and receive feedback on their progress.</p>

<p>While this is a job — and we expect you to treat it as such — we would
hate for the summer to be all work and no play. We want to help foster
a community among your cohort.</p>
<p>We start the summer off with <a href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/2016/08/18/the-real-world-dssg/">a host of orientation
events</a>,
including a fellowship-wide picnic, a variety of icebreakers, and a
scavenger hunt for you to get to know the city. We host “Un-DSSG”, a
day for you to share your side passions (from fondue making to dance)
with your new peers. Throughout the summer, we host happy hours every
other week, and invite the larger data science, tech, startup,
government, and non-profit communities. Nearly daily, we pull out the
ping pong table after hours, often leading to intense rivalries
tracked on Slack by Pongbot.</p>
