<p>Our number one priority at DSSG is to train fellows to do data science
for social good work. This curriculum includes many things you'd find
in a data science course or bootcamp, but with an emphasis on social
science, ethics, privacy, and social issues.</p>
<p><strong>If you are applying to the program or have been accepted as a
fellow,</strong> <a href="dssg-manual/">check out the manual</a> to see how you can
prepare before arriving, what orientation and training will cover, and
what to expect from the summer.</p>
<p><strong>If you are interested in learning at home,</strong> check out the
<a href="curriculum/">tutorials and teach-outs</a> developed by our staff and
fellows throughout the summer, and to suggest or contribute additional
resources.</p>
<p>*Another one of our goals is to encourage collaborations. Anyone
interested in doing this type of work, or starting a DSSG program, to
build on what we've  learned by <strong>using and contributing to</strong> these
resources.</p>

<p>We have spent many (sort of) early mornings waxing existential over
Dunkin' Donuts while trying to define what makes a "data scientist for
social good," that enigmatic breed combining one part data scientist,
one part consultant, one part educator, and one part bleeding heart
idealist. We've come to a rough working definition in the form of the
skills and knowledge one would need, which we categorize as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Programming,</strong> because you'll need to tell your computer what to
  do, usually by writing code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Computer science,</strong> because you'll need to understand how your
  data is - and should be - structured, as well as the algorithms you
  use to analyze it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Math and stats,</strong> because <a href="https://xkcd.com/435/">everything else in life is just applied
  math</a>, and numerical results are meaningless
  without some measure of uncertainty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Machine learning,</strong> because you'll want to build predictive or
  descriptive models that can learn, evolve, and improve over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social science,</strong> because you'll need to know how to design
  experiments to validate your models in the field, and to understand
  when correlation can plausibly suggest causation, and sometimes even
  do causal inference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Problem and Project Scoping,</strong> because you'll need to be able to
  go from a vague and fuzzy project description to a problem you can
  solve, understand the goals of the project, the interventions you
  are informing, the data you have and need, and the analysis that
  needs to be done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Project management,</strong> to make progress as a team, to work
  effectively with your project partner, and work with a team to make
  that useful solution actually happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Privacy and security,</strong> because data is people and needs to be
  kept secure and confidential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ethics, fairness, bias, and transparency,</strong> because your work has
  the potential to be misused or have a negative impact on people's
  lives, so you have to consider the biases in your data and analyses,
  the ethical and fairness implications, and how to make your work
  interpretable and transparent to the users and to the people
  impacted by it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communications,</strong> because you'll need to be able to tell the story
  of why what you're doing matters and the methods you're using to a
  broad audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social issues,</strong> because you're doing this work to help people,
  and you don't live or work in a vacuum, so you need to understand
  the context and history surrounding the people, places and issues
  you want to impact.</p>
</li>
