# Machine Learning

## Motivation
You've probably heard about machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc. It's 
an integral part of data science. So we'll teach you the basics about ML: the 
process, formulating a problem in a machine learning setting, feature generation,
model selection and evaluation, and how to interpret results before eventually deploying the models. 

For a more detailed coverage of machine learning for social good and policy, you can take a look at [lectures for the Machine Learning and Public Policy class](https://github.com/dssg/MLforPublicPolicy).
