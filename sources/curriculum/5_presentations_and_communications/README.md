## Presentations and Communications
Remember that there's no point to doing data science for social good work if no one understands 
what you did and can put it to good use. You'll need to be able to communicate your work:
[Data Visualization](https://github.com/jonkeane/data-visualization-intro) and [Presentation Skills](presentation-skills/) 
will help with that, whether you're communicating your work to a public audience or to stakeholders. When you're
working directly with a project partner and are creating tools for them to use, keep
[Usability and User Interfaces](usability-and-user-interfaces/) in mind to make sure that 
whatever tools you create will be useful and usable.
