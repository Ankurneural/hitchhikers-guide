# Basic Python

Python is the language of choice here at DSSG. If you’re only going to
learn one programming language, learn Python! It’s powerful,
expressive, and easy to read (even by non-programmers).

- **Python Package & Environment Management:** To properly create a
  Python environment, we recommend you use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or
  [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html). If you feel adventurous, feel free to use pip +
  virtualenv.
