# Welcome to the Hitchhiker's Guide to Data Science for Social Good.

Our number one priority at DSSG is to train fellows to do data science
for social good work. This curriculum includes many things you'd find
in a data science course or bootcamp, but with an emphasis on solving problems with social
impact, integrating data science with the social sciences, discussing ethical implications of the work, as well as privacy, and confidentiality issues.


**If you are applying to the program or have been accepted as a
fellow,** [check out the manual](dssg-manual/) to see how you can
prepare before arriving, what orientation and training will cover, and
what to expect from the summer.

**If you are interested in learning at home,** check out the
[tutorials and teach-outs](curriculum/) developed by our staff and
fellows throughout the summer, and to suggest or contribute additional
resources.

Another one of our goals is to **encourage collaborations**. Anyone
interested in doing this type of work, or starting a DSSG program, to
build on what we've  learned by **using and contributing to** these
resources.
