# Welcome to the Hitchhiker's Guide to Data Science for Social Good.

## What is the Data Science for Social Good Fellowship?

The Data Science for Social Good Fellowship (DSSG) is a hands-on and project-based summer program that launched in 2013 at the University of Chicago and has now expanded to multiple locations globally. It brings data science fellows from across the world to work on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science projects that have a social impact. From a pool of typically over 800 applicants, 20-40 fellows are selected from diverse computational and quantitative disciplines including computer science, statistics, math, engineering, sociology, economics, and public policy backgrounds. 

The fellows work in small, cross-disciplinary teams on social good projects spanning education, health, energy, transportation, criminal justice, social services, economic development and international development in collaboration with global government agencies and non-profits. This work is done under close and hands-on mentorship from full-time, dedicated data science mentors as well as dedicated project managers, with industry experience. The result is highly trained fellows, improved data science capacity of the social good organization, and a high quality data science project that is ready for field trial and implementation, delivered at the end of the program. 

In addition to hands-on project-based training, the summer program also consists of workshops, tutorials, and discussion groups based on our data science for social good curriculum designed to train the fellows in doing practical data science and artificial intelligence for social impact.

Our number one priority at DSSG is to train fellows to do data science
for social good work. This curriculum includes many things you'd find in a data science course or bootcamp, but with an emphasis on solving problems with social impact, integrating data science with the social sciences, discussing ethical implications of the work, as well as privacy, and confidentiality issues.


**If you are applying to the program or have been accepted as a
fellow,** [check out the manual](dssg-manual/) to see how you can
prepare before arriving, what orientation and training will cover, and
what to expect from the summer.

**If you are interested in learning at home,** check out the
[tutorials and teach-outs](curriculum/) developed by our staff and
fellows throughout the summer, and to suggest or contribute additional
resources.

Another one of our goals is to **encourage collaborations**. Anyone
interested in doing this type of work, or starting a DSSG program, to
build on what we've  learned by **using and contributing to** these
resources.
